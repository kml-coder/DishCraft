## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kml-coder/DishCraft.git
cd DishCraft
```

### 2. Configure Android SDK path
Create a file named `local.properties` inside the project root if it doesn‚Äôt exist:

```
sdk.dir=C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

(Adjust path depending on your system.)

### 3. Build the APK
```bash
gradlew.bat build   # Windows
./gradlew build     # Mac/Linux
```

If successful, the APK will be generated here:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```
### 2. On a emulator
1. Make sure your **ANDROID_HOME** is in the right location if not:
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
   ```
2. Check what emulator you have, and select one and run it:
   ```bash
   emulator -list-avds
   emulator -avd <your_avd_name>
   ```
   When it runs, turn on another terminal, and move to DishCraft/app/build/outputs/apk/debug
   ```bash
   cd app/build/outputs/apk/debug
   ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb install app-debug.apk

## üöß Notes / Troubleshooting
- **Lint Errors**: If lint errors block build, you can disable abort-on-error in `build.gradle.kts`:  
  ```kotlin
  android {
      lint {
          abortOnError = false
          checkReleaseBuilds = false
      }
  }
  ```
